        <h2>What This Portfolio Demonstrates</h2>
        <p>
            The portfolio shows how I planned, analyzed, and enhanced existing projects to meet the outcomes
            of the Computer Science program. Each artifact highlights improvements in software quality,
            readability, security, and performance. Together they demonstrate my ability to design,
            implement, and explain computing solutions that provide real value.
        </p>
        <p>
            This work also reflects my professional development in areas such as collaboration, communication,
            problem solving, and attention to detail. The portfolio is designed for hiring managers, technical
            leads, and other stakeholders who want to see clear evidence of my skills and my readiness for
            an entry level role in the field of computer science.

        <h2>Capstone Artifacts and Enhancements</h2>
        <p>
            The portfolio centers on three major enhancements that align with the key capstone categories:
            software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases.
            Each artifact includes the original version, the enhanced version, and a written narrative
            describing the improvements.
        </p>

        <h3>Software Design and Engineering</h3>
        <p>
            The software design and engineering enhancement focuses on improving structure, validation logic,
            and maintainability in an existing application. The work emphasizes clean design, clear error
            handling, and testable components. This artifact shows my ability to refactor legacy code into
            a more reliable and professional solution.
        </p>

        <h3>Algorithms and Data Structure</h3>
        <p>
            The algorithms and data structure enhancement concentrates on efficiency and clarity in data handling.
            In this artifact I improved search logic and data processing so that the application can handle
            information more quickly and more flexibly. The enhancement demonstrates my understanding of
            algorithmic thinking, complexity, and tradeoffs in design choices.
        </p>

        <h3>Databases</h3>
        <p>
            The databases enhancement highlights my ability to design and work with persistent data storage.
            This artifact demonstrates skills in modeling data, interacting with a database from application
            code, and ensuring that data operations remain consistent, secure, and aligned with user needs.
            It shows how I integrate backend logic with a data layer in a way that supports real use cases.
        </p>

        <p>
            While each artifact focuses on a different category, together they form a complete picture of my
            abilities across the full development lifecycle, from design and implementation to testing,
            optimization, and documentation.

        <h2>Skills and Program Outcomes Highlighted</h2>
        <p>
            Across the portfolio I demonstrate the following abilities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Building collaborative environments and supporting decision making through clear code reviews,
                comments, and documentation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Creating professional written, visual, and oral explanations of technical work that are adapted
                to different audiences.
            </li>
            <li>
                Designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles and standard practices,
                while managing tradeoffs between simplicity, performance, and maintainability.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using well founded tools, techniques, and workflows to deliver software that aligns with
                industry expectations and organizational goals.
            </li>
            <li>
                Applying a security mindset by identifying possible weaknesses, validating input, and considering
                how future changes may affect the reliability and safety of the system.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These skills are demonstrated both in the enhanced code and in the narratives that explain the design
            decisions behind each artifact.
